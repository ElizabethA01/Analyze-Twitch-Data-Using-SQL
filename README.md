# Analyze-Twitch-Data-Using-SQL-And-Python

> https://www.codecademy.com/courses/dspath-twitch/articles/twitch-project

In this project, I will visualize Twitch data using Python and Matplotlib, in the forms of:

- Bar Graph: Featured Games
- Pie Chart: Stream Viewersâ€™ Locations
- Line Graph: Time Series Analysis

## General Information
- The purpose of this project was to analyze the Twitch gaming data using Python (Pandas) and SQL. Next I wanted to visualize the findings using Matploblib on Jupyter Notebook. 
- I undertook the project as part of a course I undertook on Codecademy.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas and Matploblib)
- SQL
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Status
Project is: _completed_

## My Thoughts
I enjoyed this project because I was able to analyze the Twitch gaming data and conclude different findings on the top games (top 10), the highest viewers in the span of 24 hours and the countries that contributed to the highest views. Also, I was able to practice how to visualize the data using Python and how to analyze the data using both sql and python. My overall thoughts is that SQL is easy to use to get the quick answers when analyzing data and Python is better suited for more detailed analysis.
